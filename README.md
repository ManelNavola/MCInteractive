Making Twitch interact with Minecraft!

## About
MC Interactive is a Minecraft Bukkit plugin that enables and encourages Twitch viewer interaction with
customizable in-game features, such as being able to read Twitch chat in-game, starting votes,
event votes, and in-game Twitch subscription and cheering rewards.

Twitch interaction is performed via reading messages of Twitch channels using their IRC API, logged in as an anonymous users. This means some features are not possible with this implementation, such as sending back messages to channels.
